Introduction
----------
My aim is to provide a solution of labyrinth.

> In Greek mythology, the Labyrinth (Greek λαβύρινθος labyrinthos, possibly the building complex at Knossos) was an elaborate structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos. Its function was to hold the Minotaur, a mythical creature that was half man and half bull and was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus. *[Labyrinth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia][]*

While running me, consumers are supposed to open diagram(s) of a labyrinth. After that, it's my job to give the shortest path which exists.

I attempt to recognize labyrinths using OpenCV Library, and store them in a certain data structure. Then I'll do the PathFinding.
